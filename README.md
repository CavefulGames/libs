# CavefulGames/libs
Some public libraries for Roblox

# Note
- These libraries are not very common for vary cases unlike kitty's library kit.
- Recently published into `pesde` experimentally.
- Most of our libraries' docs use Korean(한국어).
- We recently switched the package manager and registry location from `wally` to `pesde`. Packages in `wally` are no longer updated.
